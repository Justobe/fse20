# Status

We apply for the **reusable** badge. We believe that IoTCheck fulfills the criteria for this badge for the following reasons:

1. IoTCheck is available for public use (see INSTALL.md in this folder).
2. IoTCheck is documented carefully with relevant information and instructions for 
[supporting materials](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck-data/blob/master/README.md),
[Vagrant](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck-vagrant/blob/master/README.md), 
[IoTCheck](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck/blob/master/README.md), 
[IoTCheck Wiki](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck/wiki) that provides more detailed explanation to supplement the description we have in the paper (see **Section 7**).
3. IoTCheck can be installed and used to reproduce the results we have presented in the paper. We have also [released the detailed results of our experiments here](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck-data). Rerunning IoTCheck will produce consistent results that can be checked against the released detailed results.
4. The consistency and reproducibility of IoTCheck's results will facilitate the reuse and repurposing of IoTCheck to spawn and support future research in the new area of conflict detection for smart home apps.
