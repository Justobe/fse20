We are applying for the Reusable badge. We believe ARDiff deserves the badge because it is: 

* Well-documented: all required steps for running the tool are included in the INSTALL.md file. 
* Consistent: the results reported in the paper were produced using the implementation of the tool. Thus, the implementation corresponds to the results reported in the paper. 
* Complete: the full source code, as well as the dependencies for the tool, are provided. Benchmarks and examples of running the tool on the benchmarks are also included.
* Exercisable: the scripts for running the tools on the benchmarks used in the paper are provided (Linux/Mac/Windows users). 

Moreover, ARDiff code is modular, extensible, and is thoroughly commented, which allows researchers to adjust the tool to their needs and bootstrap their own research. It also includes a re-implementation of two other approaches whose implementation is not public. As such, ARDiff can be seen as a framework incorporating different approaches for equivalence checking.
