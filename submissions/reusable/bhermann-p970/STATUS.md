# Community Expectations for Research Artifacts and Evaluation Processes
## Status Declaration

We submit the artifact for review in the "reusable" category, because of the following points:
- The artifact is functional in that sense that it is complete (contains all data and scripts used for the research which is not already publicly archived) and the summary processes executable as R scripts.
- We carefully documented each item especially making sure our data artifacts are documented fully.
- We deem our data to be reusable for other studies.
  - The collection of calls for artifacts can be used to study the progression of evaluation methodology over time.
  - In general our data can be reused to study the advancements made in 5 or 10 years after our initial study.
  - Our data can be used to compare against artifact evaluation experience in other communities (e.g. systems, security, computational biology, CHI, ...).
- We believe our scripts to be tailored to the study, but parts of them might be useful for other researchers that want to duplicate the methodology or export derived data that we currently did not need in a persistent form.
- Also the scripts foster replication of results even when the manual step (open card sorting) would be executed by a different team maybe leading to different labeling.

Furthermore, as mentioned before, we see the artifact as "functional". We also consider it as "available" as we maintain it using a GitHub repository and archive releases of this repository to Zenodo, which provides as DOI as well as a guarantee for artifact retention.
