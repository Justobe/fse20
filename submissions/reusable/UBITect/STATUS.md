We would like to apply for three badges: Reusable, Functional, and Available Badges.

* Available: We open sourced our code in Github:
https://github.com/seclab-ucr/UBITect.git

* Functional: We have documents about the code structure and installation instructions for UBITect. The README.md also provides the way to prepare the  LLVM bitcode files of OS kernels, which is necessary to apply UBITect to the kernel.

* Reusable: We provide all the code and the step-to-step tutorial to use the tool and inspect the result.
