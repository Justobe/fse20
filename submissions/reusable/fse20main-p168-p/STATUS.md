We apply for the badges `reusable`, `functional`, and `available`.

Our artifacts are publically available on figshare and have a DOI.
Further, the JMH fork implementing our paper's approach is available as part of the artifact as well as on [Github](https://github.com/sealuzh/jmh).
Hence, they meet the `available` requirements.

We provide extensive information on how to set up the environment to reuse the artifact as well as the JMH fork within an own project.
Further, we provide all data and scripts to replicate our paper's result.
We divide it into multiple steps, some of which take a long time to execute, and provide intermediate data files for others to skip certain (e.g., long running) steps.
All input to our scripts can be generated by other scripts, which ensures that with our replication package, one is able to run the same experiments for *other* projects/study subjects.
Therefore, we are confident that our artifacts meet the requirements for `functional` and `reusable`.
