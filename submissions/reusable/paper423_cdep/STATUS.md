We are applying for available, functional and reusable badges.

- First, We deserve the available badge because we release the whole datasets and codes on a publicly accessible archival repository.

- Second, We deserve the functional badge.
  - We have a comprehensive README.md file for describing how to build and use our codes, how to interpret the results and so on.
  - To make sure our codes could function on any platform, we provide three ways to compile and run our codes -- downlooading a prebuilt docker image, building a docker image locally and using maven to compile the whole project.  
  - We illustrate some example cases in the README.md to help verify and validate the results from our project.
  
- Third, we deserve the reusable badge.
  - In the README.md file, we describe the code structures and how our tool is designed to help readapt it for other purposes.
  - We provide the whole dataset in our study which could be further analyzed by other research projects.
  - Our tool could easily be extended to support more applications.
  - Our tool is supported by docker, so that the usage of it won't be limited by platforms.
