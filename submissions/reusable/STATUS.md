# Overview
We're applying for the reusable badge with this artifact for our paper titled "XYZ: Statically Summarizing Regions For Efficient Symbolic Execution Of Java". The title of our camera-ready paper will replace the XYZ with Java Ranger.

# Justification
The core of our results is presented in Table 2 of our submission. This table summarizes the performance of Java Ranger on 9 benchmarks and compares it with SPF. Our artifact allows the results in the submission to be reproduced. Furthermore, we've added documentation for all of our code and made it [available here](https://sohah.github.io/VeritestingTransformations/). Java Ranger also comes with instructions to set it up in IntelliJ and with run configuration files that allow any user to run Java Ranger on the 9 benchmarks, out of the box.
