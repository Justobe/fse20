## Sumbmission type

This is a submission for the Reusable badge.

## Reasons

  - The artifacts are permanently archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3876048 (available).

  - The artifacts are well-documented, consistent with the claims in the
  paper, and include appropriate evidence (functional).

  - We went a step further by open sourcing the software. It can be directly
  used by others to replicate the results published in the paper. Also, the
  software is well-documented and designed as a framework that can be
  re-used for binary analysis research well beyond coverage analysis (reusable).
