# Status

We are applying for the "reusable" badge as we believe that we provide fully
functional a) analysis scripts + data, b) the fully usable application we used
for the experiment, and c) reusable, editable tasks. Replicating the experiment
is as easy as hosting the docker images on a server and starting to recruit (at
least from perspective of providing artifacts, you might have to get IRB or
other ethics board approval and might have to change the pages of the
application to reflect your permission)

The provided application can also be reused to make your own experiments with
some adjustments. Please contact Dr. Drews or Dr. Stefik for guidance.
