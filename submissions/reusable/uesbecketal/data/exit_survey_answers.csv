of the ORM design, the join metaphor feels tricky if some field names collide; also the and/or operators seem horrible (perhaps it would be nicer to treat queries as sets of requirements and have query-combinators to build larger ones of these? and then one could have negations as well). last thing, this search/filter syntax is disgusting, as one cannot use a chain of method calls,the query needs to be names which misses the point.

btw the syntax having semicolons is hilarious; they were introduced in 60s because it was easier to implement parsers (at most 1 token lookahead -- save the RAM!).
also the convention of naming variables with type, say Query somethingQuery -- disgusting, but that's not the language itself.

In terms of debugging, it was pretty fair in describing the errors, the logical errors were tough to find, but not impossible to debug. I understand that this language is still in development , but it would help out better to include coloring in keywords for visual help. There was also an issue of not seeing the contents of certain tables until you have to compile them. I had the confusion that we were suppose to create our own lists when one was already provided, but not visible to the programmer. If it's meant to be reading a from an external file than it's fine, but there should be tasks that include creating your own table of information.Other than that everything was OK.";"Just a little note. Some of the questions I wasn't able to turn in because I kept returning null when in debugging it said to return the table. in C++, I'm used to return 0 when compiling a file to tell the computer no errors were made, so I had the same assumption with return null. It would help to include the return in the example file, so as people can see the comparison.  Sadly it took me too long to notice the problem.

This study was pretty fun. It reminded me of a game called if else.Hearbreak, where you learn the developer's coding language called Sprak (Swedish translated:language) ,which was inspired from BASIC, that let you modify the data of objects in a 3D environment. 

I'm curious as to what was the inspiration to this language.

Lastly, I'd be happy to try out future studies to help further perfect this language.
";"I did switch between this language and c++, to which I felt this program was much simpler with having already built in functions to work with. Much of the assignment were manipulating outputs and dealing with data classes of information, which I felt comfortable for some of the questions. In terms of whether it affected my progress, it gave me some references when dealing with strings, integers, and assignment operators. But from the aspect of learning a new language, I heavily relied on the examples given from the start of the study, finding certain patterns that fit the criteria of the assignments, and then rewrite and combine certain code to see the affects.

It would also be convenient if this language has an option to have more than two comparison conditions to work in one line/statement of code.

"5cd62e58837f2";"2";"Senior";"The only thing that was frustrating was realizing that the example code used a void function, while the code I had to write was inside a Table function, so I had to return the table instead of trying to output it and then return null.

Some syntax used double quotes while others used single quotes.
