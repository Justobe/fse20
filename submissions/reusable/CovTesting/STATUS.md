We would like to apply for all three badges: **Reusable**, **Functional**, and **Available** Badges.

We have provided all the codes we use to generate all figures and tables in our paper and put them in individual folders, respectively. So we think we deserve the **Available** badge. 

We have provided the instructions of installation and the description of how to reproduce the results presented in our paper (see README.md in every folder). If users run the codes based on our data and according to our instructions, they can get the same results as those shown in out paper. So we think we deserve the **Functional** badge.

Moreover, we also provided the instructions of experimenting on the user's own data. In these instructions, we take our models and data as examples to show the general steps to get the similar results to our results. If the user has his/her own model or dataset, he/she just need to substitute them and follow the instructions to get his/her own similar results. So we think we deserve the **Reusable** badge.
