Codes for paper: Correlations Between Deep Neural Network Model Coverage Criteria and Model Quality



## Dependencies:

The experiments are run by python 3.6 or 3.7 under Ubuntu 18.04.  

Way 1: Get environment with preinstalled dependencies using docker: 

```python
# Get the environment (OS) to run the code
$ docker pull hao359510974/covtesting2:latest
$ docker run -it --mount type=bind,src=SRC_PATH,dst=DEST_PATH hao359510974/covtesting2:latest # Where SRC_PATH and DEST_PATH must be absolute paths; SRC_PATH is the path on your host machine, and DEST_PATH is the file path for where you want it to be stored in the Docker, such as '/data'.
    
#Experiments (take Comparison of Attack Images (Table 2) as an example, for other experiments just use other folders.)
$ cd /data/Comparison\ of\ Attack\ Images/

Then run commands according to 'README' file to get corresponding results. 
```

Way 2: We also provide [requirements.txt](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/blob/master/requirements.txt) file for users who want to establish the environment on their own machine:

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Before Start (Prepare the Data Used in Experiments):

Step 1: Download data and codes:

Download data and codes through the DOI link: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3908793"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3908793.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

You will get two zip files: 'all-data.zip' (12.2 G, the data file) and 'DNNTesting/CovTesting-v1.1.zip' (5.2 M, the codes file). Please unzip the codes and data files to get the codes and data for experiments. After unzipping 'all-data.zip', you will get three zip files named 'data.zip' (4.1 G), 'Table 2 data.zip' (3.5 G) and 'Table 3 data.zip' (4.6 G).

(We also provide a Google Drive link for users to download the data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16w93LPkaF0AP9QxIty9Y6ipU-N4cbPUd?usp=sharing. )

Step 2: Put the data folders at corresponding locations

1. Unzip 'data.zip' and get three folders: 'cifar_data', 'mnist_data' and 'svhn_data'. Please put these three folders under the ['data' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/data) in the main folder. 
2. Unzip 'Table 2 data.zip' and get three folders: 'cifar_data', 'mnist_data' and 'svhn_data'. Please put these three folders under the ['data' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Comparison%20of%20Attack%20Images/data) under the ['Comparison of Attack Images' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Comparison%20of%20Attack%20Images). 
3. Unzip 'Table 3 data.zip' and get two folders: 'data' and 'new_model'. Please merge these two folders into the ['data' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Model%20Accuracy%20under%20Different%20Scenarios/data) and the ['new_model' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Model%20Accuracy%20under%20Different%20Scenarios/new_model) under the ['Model Accuracy under Different Scenarios' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Model%20Accuracy%20under%20Different%20Scenarios), respectively.
