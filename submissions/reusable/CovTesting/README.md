Codes for paper: Correlations Between Deep Neural Network Model Coverage Criteria and Model Quality



## Dependencies:

The experiments are run by python 3.6 or 3.7 under Ubuntu 18.04.  

Way 1: Install the required dependencies according to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/blob/master/requirements.txt) file. 

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

Way 2: Get environment with preinstalled dependencies using docker: 

```python
# Get the environment (OS) to run the code
$ docker pull hao359510974/covtesting1:latest
$ docker run -it -v YOUR_LOCATION:/data IMAGE_ID  # YOUR_LOCATION is the location of the codes in your computer; IMAGE_ID is the ID of image: hao359510974/covtesting1:latest 

#Experiments (take Comparison of Attack Images (Table 2) as an example, for other experiments just use other folders.)
$ cd /data/Comparison\ of\ Attack\ Images/

Then run commands according to 'README' file to get corresponding results. But please use '$ python3 xxxxx' instead of '$ python xxxxxxx' in the docker. 
For example, to get the comparison results of MNIST LeNet1 in this experiment, please run: '$ python3 criteria.py  -dataset mnist  -model lenet1'
```

## Before Start (Prepare the Data Used in Experiments):

Step 1: Download data:

Download data from Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16w93LPkaF0AP9QxIty9Y6ipU-N4cbPUd?usp=sharing. (You can also download the data through the 'DOI' shown above). You will get three zip files named 'data-002.zip' (4.1 G), 'Table 2 data-001. zip' (3.5 G) and 'Table 3 data-003.zip' (4.6 G). 

Step 2: Put the data folders at corresponding locations

1. Unzip 'data-002.zip' and get three folders: 'cifar_data', 'mnist_data' and 'svhn_data'. Please put these three folders under the ['data' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/data) in the main folder. 
2. Unzip 'Table 2 data-001. zip' and get three folders: 'cifar_data', 'mnist_data' and 'svhn_data'. Please put these three folders under the ['data' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Comparison%20of%20Attack%20Images/data) under the ['Comparison of Attack Images' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Comparison%20of%20Attack%20Images). 
3. Unzip 'Table 3 data-003.zip' and get two folders: 'data' and 'new_model'. Please merge these two folders into the ['data' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Model%20Accuracy%20under%20Different%20Scenarios/data) and the ['new_model' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Model%20Accuracy%20under%20Different%20Scenarios/new_model) under the ['Model Accuracy under Different Scenarios' folder](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/tree/master/Model%20Accuracy%20under%20Different%20Scenarios), respectively.
