This module instruments every CMP instructions of programs and records its CMP ID, CMP type and operand length. After the compilation, a detailed br_log file is saved. Rename it with [program name]_br_log. The operand values of every CMP instrutions will be catpured during runtime through an instrumented function after every CMP instructions. Note that, the operand values can be magic constants or dynamic variables.
