# Status

We apply for **Available**, **Functional**, and **Reusable** badges as we beleive our artifacts fulfil the requirements:

- Available: artifacts are publicly available.
- Functional: artifacts are functional as described in the `README.md` and `INSTALL.md` files. The reuse instructions are carefully documented, organized and mostly automated. This can be verified by the `README.md` file available in [artifacts repository](https://github.com/docable/docable/tree/master/harness) and it's corresponding directories. After installing the dependencies, executing our code is mostly automated and similar experiments to our paper can be reproduced using a few commands.
- Reuse: Careful documentation, automation and organization of our artifacts helps the reuse and repurposing of our artifacts in future research. A summary of instructions are available in [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) and a more detailed instructions can be found in the [artifacts repository](https://github.com/docable/docable).
