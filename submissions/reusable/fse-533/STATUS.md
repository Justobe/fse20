## Why

We prepared a replication package with: subject programs, tools and frameworks used in the experiments, scripts used to run the experiments, and result data. Everything is documented as requested. More information on how to use it can be found in the `README.md` file.

The only items that are not included in this package for replication are: `Java v1.8.0_231` and `R v3.5.1` distribution packages. If both are already installed in the user's machine, then the replication package works as a standalone package.
