# STATUS

## Badge

We apply for **reusable** badge.

## Reasons

We package our implementation as git patch files that can be easily used to build our prototype of JSObserver.
In *INSTALL.md* file, we provide detailed instructions on how to setup the environment and run the prototype. 
In *README.md* file, we clearly describe the data format and demonstrate the usage of data collection script and data analysis scripts.
Further, we provide bash scripts, i.e., build_jsobserver.sh and analysis.sh, to fully automate the installation, data collection and data analysis.
The dataset is also available for verification and validation.
In summary, our artifacts are carefully documented and reusable.
