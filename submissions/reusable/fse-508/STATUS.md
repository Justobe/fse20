ACM Reusable

## Why

We provide a full reproduction of industrial study on a public dataset. Because of NDA, we cannot disclose the exact dataset nor the model of our paper. However, the co-chair of the track confirmed that we can submit the reusable tool if we show that our main paper findings can be achieved on a proxy dataset. She referred to this section of the ACM review "To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included. (Proprietary artifacts need not be included. If they are required to exercise the package then this should be documented, along with instructions on how to obtain them. Proxies for proprietary data should be included so as to demonstrate the analysis.)"

Our artifact evaluates the full research question on the Lending Club dataset showing to some extent:
* Random & Tree based attacks do not achieve sufficient performance on real-world systems
* Multi-objective Genetic search can actual find real-system adversarial examples and the combination of the 3 objectives + constraints we propose yields the best results
* We can use the previously generated examples to improve the robustness of the system.
