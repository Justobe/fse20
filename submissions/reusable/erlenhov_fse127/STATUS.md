#Functional
The artefact is documented and instructions are found in the README.md
Both the raw data collected and the script used to analyse the results are available.

#Reusable
The purpose of our dataset is to be â€œa reusable artefact that other researchers can use to bootstrap their own research or validate our findings. Particularly, the analysis scripts can be re-used on similar studies (e.g., diverging and density plots to evaluate distributions on sampled participants), and the dataset can be used to bootstrap future studies that follow similar data collection methods (available in our interview guide and processed data).
