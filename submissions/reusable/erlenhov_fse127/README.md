## Where to start?

If you are interested in ...

* The code for our **analysis**, read the `analysis_package.html` file.
* What we **asked practitioners**, read `Interview Guide.pdf` followed by our `Survey_Report.pdf`.
* Checking and changing our code, open `analysis_package.R`. We recommend creating an [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/) project.

**Note:** Make sure you have the latest version of R installed. We used `R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12)`
