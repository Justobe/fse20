# Flexeme

This artefact submission includes all novel code written for the ESEC/FSE Research Papers Track, submission 205: "Flexeme: Untangling Commits Using Lexical Flows".
The paper proposes a novel representation of patches by projecting them onto PDGs and proposes two new methods of untangling commits using this representation.

This artefact allows recreating the artificial corpus presented in the paper and running both the proposed methods as well as the considered baselines on this corpus.

The tool can be obtained from the public repository: https://github.com/PPPI/Flexeme

Additionally, we archive the latest release via Zenodo as follows:
- [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/265828516.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/265828516)

The repository [README.md](https://github.com/PPPI/Flexeme/blob/master/README.MD) includes details on how to run the tool.
