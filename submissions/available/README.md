# Model-based Exploration of the Frontier of Behaviours for Deep Learning System Testing

## General Information ##
This repository contains the replication package for the paper "Model-based Exploration of the Frontier of Behaviours for Deep Learning System Testing" by Vincenzo Riccio and Paolo Tonella, to be published in the proceedings of the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE 2020).

## Repository Structure ##
The package is structured as follows:

* __DeepJanus-MNIST__ contains the DeepJanus tool adapted to the handwritten digit classification case study and the instructions on how to use it;
* __DeepJanus-BNG__ contains the DeepJanus tool adapted to the self-driving car case study and the instructions on how to use it;
* __experiments__ contains the raw experimental data reported in the paper and the scripts to obtain the data.

_Note:_ each sub-package contains further specific instructions.
