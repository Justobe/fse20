We apply for the __Available Badge__.

* We provide ExAssist, a code recommendation tool for exception handling. ExAssist can predict what types of exception could occur in a given piece of code and recommend proper exception handling code for such exceptions. The tool could be used by programmers when programming or other researchers in exception handling. 

* We provide a dataset of 750 exception related bugs and fixes manually curated from 21 mobile apps. By providing real-world exception-handling bugs and fixes, we hope to provide the research community a corpus of knowledge that will leverage and accelerate further research in exception handling.
