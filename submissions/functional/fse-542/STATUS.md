# Status

We apply for the badge of type "reusable." Functional artifacts must be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation. We explain how our submission conforms to the listed criteria, as detailed by the ACM guidelines (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging) in the following.


- Documented: "At minimum, an inventory of artifacts is included, and sufficient description provided to enable the artifacts to be exercised." We provide a list and description of each of the artifacts in `README.md`. `INSTALL.md` also contains information regarding the installation requirements and the execution process of one of the artifacts.

- Consistent: "The artifacts are relevant to the associated paper, and contribute in some inherent way to the generation of its main results." The study conducted for this paper comprehends two data collection methods (i.e., an online survey and semi-structured interviews), we provide artifacts related to each method.

- Complete: "To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included. (Proprietary artifacts need not be included. If they are required to exercise the package then this should be documented, along with instructions on how to obtain them. Proxies for proprietary data should be included so as to demonstrate the analysis.)" We provide a spreadsheet (csv) containing the anonymized results from our online survey. We also provide a script that we used to  automatically analyze the data. Concerning the interviews, we cannot provide the audios and transcriptions due to confidentiality and privacy concerns, but we provide our codebook as proxies for proprietary data.

- Exercisable: "Included scripts and/or software used to generate the results in the associated paper can be successfully executed, and included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated." The submission of our artifact contains an R script to format, analyze, and plot the data from the online survey. The data is provided as a CSV-formated spreadsehet, which can be easily manipulated if required.

- Verification and validation (no definition provided by ACM): Our study provides qualitative and quantitative evidence on  software engineering practices in robotisc software engineering, allowing to verify and validity existing subjective ideas about this domain.

In summary, we prepared a replication package for the submission (also available on a dedicated website https://sites.google.com/view/empirical-study-robotics-se/home). All our artifacts are documented as requested, so data is not only available but also reusable.
