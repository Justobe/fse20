We are applying for **available**, **functional** and **reusable** badges.

- **Available**: The artifacts are available both on Github (https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/cdep-fse.git) and Zenodo with a DOI (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3877326).

- **Functional**: Our code is fully functional. We provide the Docker image with pre-built binaries which can be directly used to reproduce the results in the paper. We also release our datasets with detailed descriptions. Specifically:
  - Our `README.md` documents in detail how to build and run the cDep tool and how to reproduce our results;
  - Our `README.md` documents two ways to build the cDep from source code: (1) building in a docker image and (2) building in a local environment;
  - Our `README.md` explains the source code and provide examples to help verify and validate our results.
  - Our `README.md` explains the the datasets and how to reproduce the findings presented in the paper.
  
- **Reusable**: Building on top of the functional badget, we furthre provide the following features for 
  - Our `README.md` describes the code structure and how our tool can be furthre developed and enhanced. Our tool could easily be extended to support more applications;
  - We provide the whole raw dataset in our study which could be further analyzed for other research purposes.
  - We provide the Docker images so the reuses can be done on any platforms that support Docker.
