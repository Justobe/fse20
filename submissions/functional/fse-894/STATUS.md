## Badge

We are applying for the **Functional** badge.

## Reason

Our artifacts package includes the input benchmark, output results, raw survey data, scripts used to compute the results reported in the paper, MAESTRO indexed Stack Overflow posts, and tool settings. We have also carefully documented the package as requested. [README.md](https://github.com/maestro-fla/fse20/blob/master/submissions/functional/fse-894/README.md) describes the organization of the artifacts and steps for reproducing the results presented in the paper, while instructions for installing the environment is discussed in [INDEX.md](https://github.com/maestro-fla/fse20/blob/master/submissions/functional/fse-894/INSTALL.md).
