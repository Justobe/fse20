We are applying for the reusable, functional, and available badges.

The artifact contains...

- A verification section that allows a user to recreate a portion of our experiment
- Everything that is needed to reproduce the experimental results presented in the paper "A Principled Approach to GraphQL Query Cost Analysis".
- An anonymized corpus of 10,000 query/response pairs for the Github and Yelp APIs can be reused to compare future work with our approach.
- A query generator can be reused to generate new graphql queries corpuses for future research
- An automated script to compare the results of the 3 open-source graphql complexity libraries that can be reused to evaluate new approaches.
