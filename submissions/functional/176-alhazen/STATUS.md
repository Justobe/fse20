# Badge

We are applying for the availablei and functional badge. 

## Reason

The first archive contains our results, enabling others to validate our data analysis. 

The second archive contains our code. The code is complete and functional. 
Alhazen is based on a number of earlier works, which means that it is build from two other tools, tied together with a python script. In addition, some subjects require old versions of e.g. glibc, and thereby can only be supplied as a docker container. This leads to a complicated setup procedure.

However, we automated the process as much as possible, and documented all necessary steps. We therefore believe that our artifact is functional.
